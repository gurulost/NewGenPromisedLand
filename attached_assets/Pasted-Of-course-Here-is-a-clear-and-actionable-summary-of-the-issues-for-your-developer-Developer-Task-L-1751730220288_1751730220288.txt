Of course. Here is a clear and actionable summary of the issues for your developer.
Developer Task List: Bug Fixes & Logic Updates
Hi [Developer Name],
We have three high-priority items that need to be addressed: a bug preventing units from moving, a camera control issue, and a flaw in the combat logic.
1. Bug: Units Spawning with Zero Movement
 * Problem: Newly created units (like Warriors) are spawning with remainingMovement set to 0. This makes them unable to move on any turn.
 * Expected Behavior: Units should spawn with their full movement range, as defined in their base stats.
 * Where to Look:
   * Check the unit creation logic within shared/logic/gameReducer.ts. When a unit is added to the gameState, ensure its remainingMovement property is being correctly initialized from its definition in shared/data/units.ts.
   * Verify the baseStats.movement values for each unit in shared/data/units.ts are correct.
 * Action: Ensure that whenever a unit is created, its remainingMovement is set to its baseStats.movement.
2. Issue: Camera Snaps Back to Origin
 * Problem: The camera automatically snaps back to a default or centered position (likely the selected unit's position). This prevents the user from freely panning around the map to observe other areas, as the camera won't stay where they put it.
 * Expected Behavior: The camera should remain in the position set by the user's panning and zooming. It should not automatically snap back unless a specific "center on unit" action is taken.
 * Where to Look:
   * In client/src/components/game/GameCanvas.tsx, we previously added a useEffect hook to animate the camera's target to the selectedUnit. This is likely the cause of the unwanted snapping.
 * Action: Please disable or remove the useEffect hook that automatically changes the OrbitControls target. The camera should only move when the user manually pans it. We can re-introduce a dedicated "center view" button later if needed.
3. Bug: Unlimited Attacks Per Turn
 * Problem: Units can attack an unlimited number of times during a single turn without penalty.
 * Expected Behavior: A unit's actions should be limited. A simple and effective rule is that a unit can only attack once per turn.
 * Where to Look:
   * The ATTACK action logic inside shared/logic/gameReducer.ts.
 * Action:
   * Add a hasAttacked property to the Unit type in shared/types/unit.ts.
   * When a unit performs an ATTACK action in the reducer, first check if unit.hasAttacked is false. If it is, allow the attack and then set unit.hasAttacked = true. If it's already true, the action should fail.
   * At the start of each player's turn, you must reset hasAttacked to false for all of that player's units.
