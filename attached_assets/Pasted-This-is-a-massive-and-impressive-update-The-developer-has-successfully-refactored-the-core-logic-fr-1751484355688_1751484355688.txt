This is a massive and impressive update. The developer has successfully refactored the core logic from a hardcoded system to a scalable, data-driven one. This is a game-changing improvement that moves the project from a prototype toward a robust and expandable game engine.

The progress here is excellent. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the new strengths and the highest-impact next steps.

### Major Successes & Strengths

1.  **The Data-Driven Modifier System:** This is the most important success. The `handleAttackUnit` function has been transformed. Instead of brittle `if/else` statements for each faction, it now uses a generic `getActiveModifiers` system. This is a professional approach that makes the game vastly easier to balance, modify, and expand with new factions, units, and abilities in the future. The implementation for `on_attack`, `on_defend`, and even `on_death` triggers is fantastic.

2.  **Robust Turn & Victory Logic:** The `handleEndTurn` function is now much more comprehensive. It correctly applies end-of-turn and start-of-turn effects using the new modifier system and adds resource generation. Crucially, it now calls `checkVictoryConditions`, which implements multiple, thematic win conditions (Faith, Military, Elimination). This adds significant strategic depth to the game loop.

3.  **Well-Implemented Tech System:** The new `handleResearchTech` handler is a complete and robust feature implementation. It correctly checks for prerequisites, cost, and whether the tech is already known, all while maintaining immutable state updates.

4.  **Clear Structure:** The reducer continues to be well-organized. The addition of new (even if placeholder) action types like `RECRUIT_UNIT` and `CAPTURE_CITY` shows a clear roadmap for future development.

### Next Steps for Highest Impact

The new data-driven architecture is excellent. The highest-impact work now involves applying this superior pattern to the remaining parts of the code and implementing the placeholder actions.

1.  **Refactor Remaining Hardcoded Logic:** The top priority is to eliminate the last few "magic numbers" and hardcoded rules to make the engine fully data-driven.
    * **In `handleMoveUnit`:** A unit's `visionRadius` (currently hardcoded as `2`) should be a property defined in its data file. Similarly, whether a terrain is passable should be a property of the terrain data, not an `if (terrain === 'water' ...)` check.
    * **In `handleEndTurn`:** The faith generation from cities is hardcoded (`playerCities * 2`). This should be driven by data; for example, a city or temple structure's data should define how much faith it generates.
    * **In Ability Helpers:** The `applyTitleOfLiberty` and `applyRameumptom` functions still contain hardcoded costs and effects. These should be fully converted to use the new modifier system.

2.  **Implement Placeholder Actions:** Now that the core engine is more robust, the next step in feature development is to build out the placeholder handlers. The priority should be:
    * `handleRecruitUnit` and `handleCaptureCity`: These are fundamental actions for this game genre.

3.  **Centralize Game Rules:** For global values that don't belong to a specific faction or unit, consider creating a `gameRules.ts` data file.
    * The victory condition thresholds in `checkVictoryConditions` (e.g., `faith > 90`, `playerCities / totalCities >= 0.8`) are perfect candidates for this. This allows for easy tweaking of the game's overall balance in one central place.

This update is a huge step in the right direction. By continuing to apply the data-driven pattern, the developer is building a powerful, flexible, and professional-quality game engine.
