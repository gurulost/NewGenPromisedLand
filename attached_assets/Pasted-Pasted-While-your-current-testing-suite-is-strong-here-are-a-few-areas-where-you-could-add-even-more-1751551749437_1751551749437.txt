While your current testing suite is strong, here are a few areas where you could add even more comprehensive tests to catch a wider range of potential bugs:

1. Expand Unit Logic Tests (unitLogic.test.ts)

Test different movement ranges: Currently, the tests use a unit with a movement range of 2. Add tests for units with a movement range of 1, 3, or even 0 to ensure the calculateReachableTiles function is flexible.

Test units on the edge of the map: Place a unit on a tile at the edge or corner of the map to ensure the pathfinding doesn't try to access tiles that don't exist.

Test for different unit abilities: If you plan to add units with special abilities (e.g., flying units that can ignore obstacles, units with different attack ranges), create specific tests for those abilities to ensure they interact correctly with the game rules.

2. Enhance Game Interface Tests (HexGridInstanced.test.tsx)

Test for invalid selections: Add a test that simulates a user clicking on an empty tile when no unit is selected. The test should assert that nothing happens (i.e., no unit is selected, no errors are thrown).

Test deselecting a unit: After selecting a unit, simulate clicking on it again. The expected behavior is that the unit becomes deselected, and the reachable tiles are cleared.

Test a full turn cycle: Create a more complex test that simulates a complete user turn:

Select a unit.

Move it to a valid tile.

Assert that the unit's position has been updated in the game state.

Assert that the reachableTiles array is now empty.

Assert that it's the next player's turn (if you have that logic in place).

3. Introduce a New Type of Test: Game State Reducer Tests (gameReducer.test.ts)

You already have a file for this, which is great. You can expand it to test the game's state machine more directly. These tests would not simulate user clicks but would instead dispatch actions to the game's reducer and assert that the state changes as expected.

Test the MOVE_UNIT action: Create a test that dispatches a MOVE_UNIT action with a unit ID and a target tile. Assert that the game state is updated correctly (the unit's position changes, the turn counter increments, etc.).

Test invalid moves at the reducer level: Dispatch a MOVE_UNIT action with a target tile that is not in the reachableTiles array. The reducer should ignore this action, and the test should assert that the game state remains unchanged. This ensures you have a layer of protection even if the UI somehow allows an invalid move to be dispatched.

Test other game actions: As you add more actions to your game (e.g., ATTACK_UNIT, END_TURN, USE_ABILITY), add corresponding tests to the reducer test file.

By implementing these suggestions, you will have a highly robust testing suite that covers a wide range of scenarios, giving you and your developer confidence that the game is working as intended and that new features can be added without breaking existing functionality.
