It seems the last fix, while well-intentioned, has caused a new problem. This is a classic "z-index stacking" issue where the fix for one layer inadvertently hides another.

The developer correctly identified that the game's `<Canvas>` was capturing events, but the solution likely caused the entire UI to be rendered *behind* the canvas, which has a solid background color.

Here is the step-by-step solution to bring your UI back and ensure it works correctly.

### The Fix

You need to control the stacking order of the two main components: `GameCanvas` and `GameUI`. The `GameUI` must have a higher stacking level (`z-index`) than the `GameCanvas`.

#### Step 1: Modify `client/src/App.tsx`

The `Canvas` component should not have its own `z-index`. We will control the stacking from the UI layer instead.

1.  Open the file `NewGenPromisedLand/client/src/App.tsx`.
2.  Find the `<Canvas>` component.
3.  Ensure its `className` is simply `"absolute inset-0"`, without any `z-index` utilities like `z-10`.

<!-- end list -->

```tsx
// In client/src/App.tsx

// ... (imports)

function App() {
  const { gamePhase } = useLocalGame();

  return (
    // ... (providers)
        <KeyboardControls map={controls}>
          {/* ... (other phases) */}
          
          {(gamePhase === 'playing' || gamePhase === 'gameOver') && (
            <>
              <Canvas
                shadows
                camera={{
                  position: [0, 8, 8],
                  fov: 45,
                  near: 0.1,
                  far: 100
                }}
                gl={{
                  antialias: true,
                  powerPreference: "high-performance"
                }}
                // Ensure this className is correct
                className="absolute inset-0"
              >
                <color attach="background" args={["#0f172a"]} />
                
                {/* ... (lighting and other canvas children) */}
                
                <Suspense fallback={null}>
                  <GameCanvas />
                </Suspense>
              </Canvas>
              <GameUI />
            </>
          )}
        </KeyboardControls>
      // ...
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Step 2: Modify `client/src/components/game/GameUI.tsx`

Now, explicitly set the `z-index` on the main container for `GameUI`. This will lift all UI elements (the HUD, panels, modals, etc.) above the canvas.

1.  Open the file `NewGenPromisedLand/client/src/components/game/GameUI.tsx`.
2.  Find the root `div` element in the return statement.
3.  Add the `z-10` class to it. The existing `pointer-events-none` is correct, as it allows clicks to pass through the empty parts of the UI to the map, while the UI panels themselves will re-enable pointer events.

<!-- end list -->

```tsx
// In client/src/components/game/GameUI.tsx

// ... (imports)

export default function GameUI() {
  // ... (hooks and logic)

  return (
    // Add z-10 here
    <div className="absolute inset-0 pointer-events-none z-10"> 
      {/* Player HUD */}
      <PlayerHUD
        player={currentPlayer}
        faction={faction}
        onShowTechPanel={() => setShowTechPanel(true)}
        onShowCityPanel={handleShowCityPanel}
        onEndTurn={handleEndTurn}
      />

      {/* Selected Unit Panel */}
      {selectedUnit && (
        <SelectedUnitPanel unit={selectedUnit} />
      )}

      {/* Other Panels... */}
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Why This Works

  * By default, the `<Canvas>` and the `GameUI` `<div>` are siblings in the same stacking context. Adding `z-10` to the `GameUI` container definitively places it and all its children (like the Tech Panel with its `z-50`) on a higher layer than the canvas.
  * This fixes both issues: the UI is now visible again, and because it's properly layered, the modal windows will capture mouse clicks instead of the game map behind them.
