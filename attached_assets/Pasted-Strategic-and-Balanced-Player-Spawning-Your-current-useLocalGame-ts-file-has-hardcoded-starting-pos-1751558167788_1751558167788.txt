Strategic and Balanced Player Spawning

Your current useLocalGame.ts file has hardcoded starting positions for players. A more robust system would ensure fair and balanced starts, which is a key aspect of strategy games like Polytopia.
Recommendation:
Create a function within your MapGenerator to determine player starting locations. This function should:
1. Divide the map: Conceptually divide the map into sectors based on the number of players.
2. Find suitable locations: Within each sector, find the best starting tile based on criteria like:
    * Not being on an undesirable tile (water, mountain).
    * Having a certain number of useful resources nearby.
    * Being a reasonable distance from other players.
3. Place Starting Units and Cities: Once a starting tile is chosen, you can place the player's initial city and units there, as you currently do in useLocalGame.ts. 

Advanced Resource Spawning
Based on Polytopia's map generation, we are refining the resource placement logic. The goal is to create resource-rich zones around cities while leaving the rest of the map intentionally sparse, driving strategic conflict over settlements.
1. Implement the "2-Tile Radius" Spawning Rule
Modify the placeResources function in shared/utils/mapGenerator.ts. Before placing any resources, the function must first identify all valid "spawnable" tiles.
A tile is considered spawnable only if it is within a 2-tile hex distance of any city or village on the map.
Resources should never be placed on tiles outside of this 2-tile radius.
This will be the primary filter for all subsequent resource logic.
2. Implement "Inner City" vs. "Outer City" Spawn Rates
We will now differentiate between tiles immediately adjacent to a city and those that are 2 tiles away.
Inner City: Tiles at a distance of 1 from a city. These should have the highest concentration of valuable resources.
Outer City: Tiles at a distance of 2 from a city. These should have a lower chance of spawning resources.Updated Code Implementation Guide

This new logic will require a significant refactor of the placeResources function.

Conceptual Code Snippet:

TypeScript
// In shared/utils/mapGenerator.ts

private placeResources(tiles: Tile[], cities: City[]): void {
    // 1. Identify all tiles within a 2-tile radius of any city
    const allCityCoordinates = cities.map(c => c.coordinate);
    const spawnableTiles = tiles.filter(tile => {
        if (tile.hasCity) return false; // Don't place on city tile itself
        
        for (const cityCoord of allCityCoordinates) {
            if (hexDistance(tile.coordinate, cityCoord) <= 2) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    });

    // 2. Iterate through only the spawnable tiles
    spawnableTiles.forEach(tile => {
        const distanceToNearestCity = Math.min(
            ...allCityCoordinates.map(cityCoord => hexDistance(tile.coordinate, cityCoord))
        );

        let spawnTable;
        if (distanceToNearestCity === 1) {
            spawnTable = this.getInnerCitySpawnTable(); // High resource rates
        } else {
            spawnTable = this.getOuterCitySpawnTable(); // Lower resource rates
        }

        // 3. Use the selected table to attempt to spawn a resource
        const resourceToSpawn = this.getResourceFromTable(spawnTable, tile.terrain);

        if (resourceToSpawn) {
            tile.resources.push(resourceToSpawn);
        }
    });
}
This refined approach, directly inspired by the provided data, will create a much more balanced and strategically compelling map. It encourages players to expand and capture cities to secure their economy, which is a core loop of great strategy games.
