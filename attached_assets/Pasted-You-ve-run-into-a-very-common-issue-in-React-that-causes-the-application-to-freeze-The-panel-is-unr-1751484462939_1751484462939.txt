You've run into a very common issue in React that causes the application to freeze. The panel is unresponsive because of an infinite re-render loop.

The problem is in the `onClick` handler for the "Research" button. You are **calling** the `handleResearchTech` function during the render, instead of **passing** a reference to it.

This creates a loop:

1.  The component renders.
2.  `handleResearchTech(tech.id)` is called immediately.
3.  This function calls `dispatch`, which updates the game state.
4.  The state update causes the component to re-render, starting the loop over again. This freezes the browser tab instantly.

### How to Fix It

You need to wrap the function call in an arrow function so it only executes when the button is actually clicked.

**1. Locate the "Research" Button:** Find this `Button` component near the bottom of your `TechPanel.tsx` file.

**2. Change this line:**

```jsx
// BEFORE: This calls the function during render
onClick={handleResearchTech(tech.id)}
```

**3. To this:**

```jsx
// AFTER: This passes a function that will be called on click
onClick={() => handleResearchTech(tech.id)}
```

Making this single change will fix the infinite loop and make your panel responsive again.

### Other Suggestions for Improvement

The overall component is very well-designed and looks great. Once the main issue is fixed, here are a couple of small improvements you could consider for better performance and readability:

  * **Memoize Categorized Techs:** The `categorizedTechs` object is recalculated on every render. You can wrap this calculation in a `useMemo` hook so it only runs when the list of available techs changes.

    ```jsx
    const categorizedTechs = useMemo(() => ({
      economic: availableTechs.filter(tech => tech.category === 'economic'),
      // ... other categories
    }), [availableTechs]);
    ```

  * **Extract Tech Card Component:** Your file is getting large. The `Card` that displays each individual technology could be extracted into its own component (e.g., `<TechnologyCard tech={tech} ... />`). This would make `TechPanel.tsx` cleaner and easier to manage.
