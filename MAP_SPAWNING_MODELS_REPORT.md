#### **Jaredite Ruins** (Any land terrain)
- **Model**: `stone.glb` (scaled 1.0x)
- **Spawn Rate**: 4% standard distribution
- **Mechanics**: Loot vs preserve choice

**Status**: âœ… Complete - All world elements use existing resource models with appropriate scaling

### 6. **Terrain Overlay Models** (Visual Enhancement)
**What Spawns**: 3D terrain features for visual depth
**When**: Rendered over the efficient HexGridInstanced system
**Current Models**:
- **Mountains**: `terrain_mountain.glb` (dramatic peaks)
- **Forests**: `terrain_forest.glb` (clustered tree canopies)
- **Hills**: `terrain_hill.glb` (gentle elevations)
- **Plains**: `terrain_plains.glb` (subtle grass details)
- **Water**: `terrain_water.glb` (water surface effects)

**Implementation**: Positioned at y=0.05 above hex grid for layered depth
**Status**: âœ… Complete - All terrain types have overlay models under 300 triangles

### 7. **Available Models in Assets**
**Additional Models in attached_assets**:
- `celestine_ore_0708203050_texture.glb` - Unused alternative metal resource
