## Test Scenarios Covered

### Primary Navigation Flow
1. **Main Interface → Construction Hall**
   - Click Construction Hall button in PlayerHUD
   - Verify Construction Hall modal opens
   - Verify proper city selection

2. **Construction Hall → Cities**
   - Click Cities button within Construction Hall
   - Verify Construction Hall closes
   - Verify City Panel opens

3. **Return Navigation**
   - Close City Panel returns to main interface
   - Close Construction Hall returns to main interface

### Alternative Scenarios
- Research panel interaction alongside Construction Hall
- Multiple modal state management
- Construction mode compatibility
- Turn transition scenarios

### Error Conditions
- Null game state handling
- Missing city data
- Undefined handler functions
- Network/performance issues

## Validation Methods

### 1. Automated Testing
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Mock-based testing for external dependencies
- Accessibility testing with testing-library

### 2. User Interaction Simulation
- Click event simulation
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Hover state verification
- Focus management validation

### 3. State Management Verification
- Modal open/close state tracking
- Game state integration testing
- Construction system compatibility
- Store action dispatching
